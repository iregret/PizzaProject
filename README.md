# PizzaProject
Lab5 is creating a Pizza GUI for ordering. Must use tabbed panes


Lab #5 Pizza: 
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
a) Find an icon of a pizza, and use it in a label with your business name that displays
across the top part of your screen, and remains there constantly.

b. Use a tabbed pane container to display different windows for pizza choices, drinks and
special items. One side of your screen should always show the running total of your
pizza, drink and special items orders.

c. Make sure you use both check boxes and radio buttons in your program and at least two
different layout managers, and at least one Border.

d. Your program must allow the user to change their mind, and unselect items.

e. Your program must also contain a button to clear entries on a screen, and to start
another order.

f. As part of your documentation for this program, include your Containment hierarchy
tree. It may be hand drawn or drawn using computer tools (Visio or Word Drawing tools, or whatever you choose)
